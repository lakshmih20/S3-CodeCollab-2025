Abstract – CodeCollab

CodeCollab is a web-based collaborative code editor designed to enable multiple users to write, edit, and execute code in real-time from remote locations. Inspired by the popular IDE VS Code, it offers essential features such as syntax highlighting, live cursor tracking, integrated chat, and multi-language support, all within a browser environment.
This project addresses the limitations of traditional IDEs that lack built-in support for real-time multi-user collaboration. Developers working remotely often face challenges like version conflicts, delayed updates, and communication gaps. CodeCollab solves these issues by providing a seamless, low-latency, real-time collaboration platform tailored for remote development, hackathons, coding interviews, and online classrooms.
Built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Socket.IO for real-time communication on the backend, it ensures scalable and efficient performance. Firebase is used for secure user authentication and real-time data synchronization, while the Monaco Editor (used in VS Code) powers the code editing experience. Piston API handles multi-language code execution on the cloud.
Key features include:

•	Real-time collaborative editing
•	Secure login and session management
•	Instant code execution results
•	Role-based user interactions (owner, developer, collaborator)
Future enhancements aim to support file upload/download, mobile responsiveness, and role-based access control for more advanced collaboration.
In conclusion, CodeCollab offers an innovative and user-friendly platform that transforms how developers and teams collaborate remotely, making it an ideal tool for today’s connected world.
