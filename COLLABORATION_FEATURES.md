### **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three-tier permission system
- **Session Security**: Invite key-based access control
- **Permission Validation**: Server-side and client-side permission checks

### **Data Persistence**
- **Browser Storage**: Local file system using browser localStorage
- **Session Persistence**: Server-side session state management
- **Auto-Sync**: Periodic synchronization every 30 seconds

## üìã Usage Instructions

### **Starting a New Session**
1. Click "Share Project or Start New Project"
2. Choose "Start New Project" or "Share Existing Project"
3. Fill in project details and access settings
4. Select files to share (if applicable)
5. Share the generated invite key with collaborators

### **Joining a Session**
1. Enter the invite key in the join session modal
2. Choose your display name
